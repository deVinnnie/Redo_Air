 * This package contains some utility classes that are useful for facilitating unit tests.
 * They can be used throughout the course, to streamline the exercises.

 * Take into account however, that they are not part of JEE itself. You will not be able to rely on this at your own
 * company's projects. That said, your colleagues may have already provided a similar infrastructure. If not, feel free
 * to use this as a source of inspiration.
